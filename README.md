1. Purpose of Git Repository:

        The purpose of this git repository is so that I have a private repo
    where I can save my work without allowing anyone to make a copy of the
    source code.

2. Favorite Lab/Assignment:

        My favorite assignment was assignment 4, security, in which we attacked
    our partner's web application from assignments 2 and 3 in order to find
    security vulnerabilities. This was my favorite assignment, because it
    was fun to hack another's notuber web application and I learned a lot
    in finding vulnerabilities in web apps.

3. How Much Have I Grown:

        I feel as if I have grown a tremendous amount: before this class,
    I didn't even know what an API was, the difference between front-end and
    back-end, or how to use Git.

4. Most Important Thing Learned:
 
        Not only have I learned a lot about the web, client/server, security, 
    etc., but I think more importantly I learned how to learn: not everything 
    is going to be spoon fed to me and it is up to me in order to find 
    relevant information online. I think learning how to use revision control 
    with Git will serve more very well in the future.

5. Interested in Pursuing:
       
        I am interested in learning more about both front end and security. I 
    have enjoyed the little front-end that I have done in this class, especially 
    because I am a visual person who likes to create things so I am interested
    in building my skills in front-end. Also, I am very interested in security
    and learning how to better protect web apps and more.
